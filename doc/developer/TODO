                             Eggdrop 1.9 TODO

1. Introduction

  As described in TAGS, just try a 'grep -Hrn XXX ' to a get a list of current
  todos which may not be yet listed in here. Some larger todos (like the help
  system) are not marked in the source and will be listed here.
  
1. Overview

    No   | Subject                                       | Milestone   | Status
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.1  | rewrite help system                           | 1.9.5       | OPEN
    2.2  | xml parser errors are wrong                   | 1.9.0       | OPEN
    2.3  | restart/rehash needs to be revised            | 1.9.0       | OPEN


2. Details

  2.1. Rewrite help system

    Currently all help-*.xml files are loaded into memory. Though this isn't
    that drastic (1.6 help files were ~40kb) it would be nice if they are just
    read on .help and then thrown away.

    This may safe us some memory, but introduce higher CPU times, but .help 
    isn't used that often it will decrase memory usage a lot on larger shell
    providers.

    So make a configuration option like "help.keep_in_memory" which indicates
    if all help files are loaded on startup and are kept in memory or are 
    read on every '.help' command.

  2.2 Xml parser errors are wrong

    When loading our config.xml errors like:

       <serverlist>
          <server>bla</server
       </serverlist>

    are reported wrong. Currently "Only one root element is allowed" is reported
    due to our parser logic which just stops if it hits an error. Valid error is
    "Missing closing character '>' not found".

    Also a lot of errors missing, i suggest looking at common parsers like sax
    or expat and copy most of them.

  2.3 Restart/rehash needs to be revised
 
    Currently our '.restart' mechanism is optimized for tracking down memory leaks,
    Therefore all memory allocated is shut down. This may not be the right way
    to do this since you e.g. don't want to disconnect existing partyline sessions 
    if you do a .restart.
