                           Eggdrop Core Settings


This file describes the syntax and all the settings of your Eggdrop
configuration file. Please note that you don't need to set all of these
variables to make your bot work properly.


##### EXECUTABLE PATH #####


The first line in an Eggdrop configuration file should contain
a fully qualified path to your Eggdrop executable. It has to be
implemented in the way the example shows to make the config file
work as a shell script.

Example:

#! /path/to/eggdrop


##### BASIC STUFF #####

You can change the basic Eggdrop appearance and behavior in this section.

  set myname "LamestBot"
    This is used to identify the bot. You MUST set this.


  set username "lamest"
    This setting defines the username the bot uses on IRC. This setting has 
    no effect if an ident daemon is running on your bot's machine.


  set admin "Lamer <email: lamer@lamest.lame.org>"
    This setting defines which contact person should be shown in .status,
    /msg help, and other places. You really should include this information.


  set network "SomeIrcNetwork"
    This setting is used only for info to share with others on your botnet.
    Set this to the IRC network your bot is connected to.


  set dcc_command_chars "./"
    These characters at the beginning of text signify a command on the
    partyline.


  set timezone "EST"
    This setting defines the timezone is your bot in. It's used for internal
    routines as well as for logfile timestamping and scripting purposes.
    The timezone string specifies the name of the timezone and must be three
    or more alphabetic characters. For example, Central European Time(UTC+1)
    should be "CET".


  set offset "5"
    The offset setting specifies the time value to be added to the local 
    time to get Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT). The offset is 
    positive if the local timezone is west of the Prime Meridian and 
    negative if it is east. The value (in hours) must be between -23 and
    23. For example, if the timezone is UTC+1, the offset is -1.


  set env(TZ) "$timezone $offset" (disabled by default)
    If you don't want to use the timezone setting for scripting purposes only,
    but instead everywhere possible, then use this setting.


  set my_ip "99.99.0.0"
  set my_ip6 "3ffe:1337::1"
    If you're using virtual hosting (your machine has more than 1 IP), you may
    want to specify the particular IP to bind to. my_ip will be used for IPv4
    hosts, and my_ip6 will be used for IPv6 hosts.


##### LOG FILES #####

Eggdrop is capable of logging various things, from channel chatter to
partyline commands and file transfers.

Logfiles are normally kept for 24 hours. Afterwards, they will be renamed
to "(logfilename).yesterday". After 48 hours, they will be overwritten by
the logfile of the next day.


  set max_logsize 0
    This is the maximum size of your logfiles. Set it to 0 to disable.
    This value is in kilobytes, so '550' would mean cycle logs when it
    reaches the size of 550 kilobytes. Note that this only works if you
    have keep-all-logs set to 0 (OFF).


  set quick_logs 0
    This could be good if you have had a problem with logfiles filling
    your quota/hard disk or if you log +p and publish it to the web, and
    you need more up-to-date info. Note that this setting might increase
    the CPU usage of your bot (on the other hand it will decrease your RAM
    usage).

  set raw_log 0
    This setting allows you the logging of raw incoming server traffic via
    console/log flag 'r', raw outgoing server traffic via console/log mode 'v',
    raw botnet traffic via console/log mode 't', and raw share traffic via
    console/log mode 'h'. These flags can create a large security hole,
    allowing people to see user passwords. This is now restricted to +n users
    only. Please choose your owners with care.

  logfile <logflags> <channel> "logs/logfile"
    This setting tells the bot what should be logged, from where, and to
    which file.

    Logfile flags:
      b - information about bot linking and userfile sharing
      c - commands
      d - misc debug information
      h - raw share traffic
      j - joins, parts, quits, and netsplits on the channel
      k - kicks, bans, and mode changes on the channel
      m - private msgs, notices and ctcps to the bot
      o - misc info, errors, etc (IMPORTANT STUFF)
      p - public text on the channel
      r - raw incoming server traffic
      s - server connects, disconnects, and notices
      t - raw botnet traffic
      v - raw outgoing server traffic
      w - wallops (make sure the bot sets +w in init-server)
      x - file transfers and file-area commands

    Note that modes d, h, r, t, and v can fill disk quotas quickly. There are
    also eight user-defined levels (1-8) which can be used by Tcl scripts.

    Each logfile belongs to a certain channel. Events of type 'k', 'j', and 'p'
    are logged to whatever channel they happened on. Most other events are
    currently logged to every channel. You can make a logfile belong to all
    channels by assigning it to channel "*".

    Examples:

    logfile mco * "logs/eggdrop.log"
    logfile jpk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

    In 'eggdrop.log', put private msgs/ctcps, commands, misc info, and errors
    from any channel.

    In 'lamest.log', log all joins, parts, kicks, bans, public chatter, and
    mode changes from #lamest.


  set keep_all_logs 0
    If you want to keep your logfiles forever, turn this setting on. All 
    logfiles will get the suffix 
    ".[day, 2 digits][month, 3 letters][year, 4 digits]". Note that your 
    quota/hard-disk might be filled by this, so check your logfiles
    often and download them.


  set logfile_suffix ".%d%b%Y"
    If keep_all_logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of the logfiles.
    The default will result in a suffix like "04May2000". "%Y%m%d" will produce
    the often used yyyymmdd format. Read the strftime manpages for more options.
    NOTE: On systems which don't support strftime, the default format will
    be used _always_.


  set switch_logfiles_at 300
    You can specify when Eggdrop should switch logfiles and start fresh.
    use military time for this setting. 300 is the default, and describes
    03:00 (AM).


##### CONSOLE #####
  
  set console "mkcobxs"
    This is the default console mode. It uses the same event flags as the log
    files do. The console channel is automatically set to your "primary" channel,
    which is set in the modules section of the config file. Masters can change
    their console channel and modes with the '.console' command.



##### FILES AND DIRECTORIES #####

  set userfile "LamestBot.user"
    Specify here the filename your userfile should be saved as.


  set pidfile "pid.LamestBot"
    Specify here the filename Eggdrop will save its pid to. If no pidfile is
    specified, pid.(myname) will be used.


  set help_path "help/"
    Specify here where Eggdrop should look for help files. Don't modify this
    setting unless you know what you're doing!


  set text_path "text/"
    Specify here where Eggdrop should look for text files. This is used for
    certain Tcl and DCC commands.


  set temp_path "/tmp"
    Set here a place to store temporary files.


  set motd "text/motd"
    The MOTD (Message Of The day) is displayed when people dcc chat or telnet
    to the bot. Look at doc/text-substitutions.doc for options.


  set telnet_banner "text/banner"
    This banner will be displayed on telnet connections. Look at
    doc/text-substitutions.doc for options.


  set userfile_perm 0600
    This specifies what permissions the user, channel, and notes files should be set to.
    The octal values are the same as for the chmod system command.

    To remind you:

           u  g  o           u  g  o           u  g  o
     0600  rw-------   0400  r--------   0200  -w-------    u - user
     0660  rw-rw----   0440  r--r-----   0220  -w--w----    g - group
     0666  rw-rw-rw-   0444  r--r--r--   0222  -w--w--w-    o - others

    Note that the default 0600 is the most secure one and should only be
    changed if you need your files for shell scripting or other external
    applications.


  set mod_path "modules/"
    This path specifies the path were Eggdrop should look for its modules.
    If you run the bot from the compilation directory, you will want to set
    this to "". If you use 'make install' (like all good kiddies do ;), this
    is a fine default. Otherwise, use your head :).



##### DCC/NETWORK #####

  listen <port> <mode>
    The listen command opens a telnet port by which you or other bots can
    interact with the Eggdrop by telneting in.

    Valid ports are typically anything between 1025 and 65535 assuming the 
    port is not already in use.

    Valid modes are 'all', 'bots', and 'users'. You can assign special ports
    for users and bots, or one for all.

    Examples:

    listen 3333 bots
    listen 4444 users

    Or:

    listen 3333 all

    There are more options for the listen command in doc/tcl-commands.doc.
    Note that if you are running more than one bot on the same machine, you 
    will want to space the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart. 10 is even better.


  set protect_telnet 0
    This setting will drop telnet connections not matching a known host. It
    greatly improves protection from IRCops, but makes it impossible to add
    hosts on limbo (NOIRC) bots or have NEW as a valid login.


  set ident_timeout 5
    This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should wait before
    a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.


  set connect_timeout 15
    This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should wait before
    a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.


  set dcc_flood_thr 3
    Specify here the number of lines to accept from a user on the partyline
    within 1 second before they are considered to be flooding and therefore
    get booted.


  set telnet_flood 5:60
    Define here how many telnet connection attempts in how many seconds from
    the same host constitute a flood. The correct format is Attempts:Seconds.


  set paranoid_telnet_flood 1
    If you want telnet-flood to apply even to +f users, set this setting to 1.


  set resolve_timeout 15
    Set here the amount of seconds before giving up on hostname/address
    lookup (you might want to increase this if you are on a slow network).



##### MORE ADVANCED SETTINGS #####

  set firewall "!sun-barr.ebay:3666"
    Set this to your socks host if your Eggdrop sits behind a firewall. If 
    you use a Sun "telnet passthru" firewall, prefix the host with a "!".


  set nat-ip "127.0.0.1"
    If you have a NAT firewall (you box has an IP in one of the following
    ranges: 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255,
    10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 and your firewall transparently changes your
    address to a unique address for your box) or you have IP masquerading
    between you and the rest of the world, and /dcc chat, /ctcp chat or
    userfile sharing aren't working, enter your outside IP here. Do not
    enter anything for my_ip if you use this setting.


  set reserved_portrange 2010:2020
    If you want all dcc file transfers to use a particular portrange either
    because you're behind a firewall, or for other security reasons, set it
    here.


  set ignore_time 15
    Set the time in minutes that temporary ignores should last.


  set hourly_updates 00
    Define here what Eggdrop considers 'hourly'. All calls to it, including such
    things as note notifying or userfile saving, are affected by this.

    Example:

      set hourly_updates 15

    The bot will save its userfile 15 minutes past every hour.


  set owner "MrLame, MrsLame"
    Un-comment this line and set the list of owners of the bot.
    You NEED to change this setting.


  set notify_newusers "$owner"
    Who should a note be sent to when new users are learned?


  set default_flags "hp"
    Enter the flags that all new users should get by default. See '.help
    whois' on the partyline for a list of flags and their descriptions.


  set whois_fields "url birthday"
    Enter all user-defined fields that should be displayed in a '.whois'.
    This will only be shown if the user has one of these extra fields.
    You might prefer to comment this out and use the userinfo1.0.tcl script
    which provides commands for changing all of these.


  set die_on_sighup 0
    Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving a SIGHUP
    kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its userfile and rehash.


  set die_on_sigterm 0
    Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving a SIGTERM
    kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its userfile and rehash.


  unbind dcc n tcl *dcc:tcl
  unbind dcc n set *dcc:set
    Comment these two lines if you wish to enable the .tcl and .set commands.
    If you select your owners wisely, you should be okay enabling these.


  unbind dcc n simul *dcc:simul
    Comment out this line to add the 'simul' partyline command (owners
    can manipulate other people on the party line). Please select owners
    wisely and use this command ethically!


  set max_dcc 50
    Set here the maximum number of dcc connections you will allow. You can
    increase this later, but never decrease it.


  set dupwait_timeout 5
    If your Eggdrop rejects bots that actually have already disconnected from
    another hub, but the disconnect information has not yet spread over the
    botnet due to lag, use this setting. The bot will wait dupwait-timeout 
    seconds before it checks again and then finally reject the bot.



##### MODULES #####

After the core settings, you should start loading modules. Modules are 
loaded by the command "loadmodule <module>". Eggdrop looks for modules in
the directory you specified by the module-path setting in the files and 
directories section.

Please note that for different configurations, different modules are needed.
Four examples:

 Channel Security Bot:
    This bot needs the channels, blowfish, console, dns, irc, and (if you 
    like) ctcp modules loaded. More is not needed and makes the bot slower.

  Public IRC Bot:
    A public bot should have all modules available loaded since they provide 
    all functions for everyday use.

  Secure Filesys Bot:
    This bot needs all normal IRC operating modules, but not the notes, seen,
    ctcp or share modules.

  Limbo Bot:
    A limbo bot (serves as a botnet hub outside IRC) just needs the channels,
    console, dns, and maybe notes or share modules loaded. Of course, blowfish
    needs to be loaded here, too.



##### SCRIPTS #####

The scripts section should be placed at the end of the config file. All modules
should be loaded and their variables should be set at this point.

  source scripts/script.tcl
    This line loads script.tcl from the scripts directory inside your Eggdrop's
    directory. All scripts should be put there, although you can place them where
    you like as long as you can supply a fully qualified path to them.

    Some commonly loaded scripts are alltools.tcl and action.fix.tcl. 
    
    The appropriate source lines are:

      source scripts/alltools.tcl
      source scripts/action.fix.tcl
