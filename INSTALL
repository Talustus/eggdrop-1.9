                  Compilation and Installation of Eggdrop


  This is the quick install guide; if you have had little or no experience
  with UNIX or Eggdrop, READ THE README FILE NOW! This file is only for
  experienced users.

  Contents:
    1. What is Eggdrop?
    2. Compiling Eggdrop 1.9


  (1) WHAT IS EGGDROP?

    Please, read the README file before attempting to set up this bot. This
    file is a quick setup guide, not a miracle worker. If you enter this file
    without basic Eggdrop knowledge, you will NOT leave with a working bot!
    Before asking ANY questions, READ THE README FILE OR YOU WILL BE BURNED
    TO A HORRIBLE DEATH! IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE I WILL PERSONALLY WALK
    TO YOUR TERMINAL AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY SNEAKER! By the way, read the
    README file.

  (2) COMPILING EGGDROP 1.9

    The build process will be simplified at a later time. For now, the basic
    steps to compiling Eggdrop 1.9 are as follows.

      1. Install the following development tools on your system:
           autoconf 2.52
           automake 1.5
           libtool  1.4.2

      2. Create the following symlinks in the Eggdrop 1.9 root directory:
           ln -s acconfig/mkinstalldirs ./
           ln -s configure.ac configure.in

      3. Run './bootstrap'.

      4. Run './configure --prefix=<install path>'.

      5. Run 'make'.

      6. Run 'make install'.
